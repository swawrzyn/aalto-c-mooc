**Objective:** Practice use of _realloc_ together with array
manipulation.

Implement function **add_to_array** that adds a single integer to the
existing dynamically allocated array of integers (_arr_). The length
of the existing array is _num_, and the new integer to be added is
given in parameter _newval_. You'll need to ensure that array is
extended to hold the additional integer. Check that the function works
correctly when called several consecutive times.

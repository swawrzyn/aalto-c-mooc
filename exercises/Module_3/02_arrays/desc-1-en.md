**Objective:** Practice use of dynamic memory allocation with integer arrays

Implement function **dyn_reader** that allocates an _int_ array for
_n_ integers. _n_ is given as argument to the function when it is
called. After allocating the array, the function should read the given
number of integers to the array from user, using the _scanf_
function. After the right amount of integers have been read, the
function returns pointer to the dynamically allocated array.

programming and TMC tools for your own computer. Different operating
systems have different installation challenges, and the below
instructions try to cover different known combinations as well as
possible.</p>
<p>If you do not want to use Netbeans, you can also use command line
tools and a separate editor, such as '<strong>vim</strong>', '<strong>emacs</strong>', '<strong>gedit</strong>' or '<strong>kate</strong>'. In
this case, you'll likely want to set up <strong><a href="#tmc-cli-install">tmc-cli</a></strong>,
that allows fetching exercises and submitting them to TMC. See
instructions below about how to do that.</p>

<li><a href="#linux">Linux</a></li>
<li><a href="#macos">Mac OS X</a></li>
<li><a href="#win">Windows</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Short summary</h2>
<p>Here are instructions for setting up the programming environment in
your own machine. There are following parts in the below instructions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Installing the basic command tools needed for compiling, debugging
  and locally testing of the C programs, i.e., gcc, make, check, pkg-config
  and gdb. <strong>It is important that you do this step first</strong>, before
  setting up Netbeans or tmc-cli.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Option A</strong>: If you prefer to use command line and editor of your
    choice, you can install a command line client for downloading
    exercise templates and submitting them to the TMC server. You can
    find detailed instructions for this <a href="#tmc-cli-install">below</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Option B</strong>: If you prefer to use Netbeans graphical IDE, you can
    find <a href="#nb-install">below</a> the instructions to install Netbeans,
    and the plugin that allows easy downloading and submission of
    exercises to TMC server.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is also possible to not use either of the above options, but to
  submit exercises using the TMC web interface in zip package. This
  may be a bit inconvenient, but a possible fallback, if neither of
  the above options work (or satisfy) you.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Following platform-specific problems are known:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>On <strong>Windows and Cygwin, local tests are known not to work</strong> in all
  cases.  If local tests still do not work, it is possible to directly
  submit exercises to the server, that will compile and test them on a
  Linux platform.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On <strong>Mac OS 10.10 Netbeans does not find pkg-config</strong> even if
  installed properly. Workaround is to start Netbeans from the
  Terminal window after it is installed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On <strong>Mac OS 10.6 (and older version) JDK 7 cannot be installed</strong>,
  and therefore Netbeans cannot be installed. In that case you will
  have to use the command line tools as described below, or if you
  want to try Netbeans, use <a href="#virtualbox">Virtualbox virtual machine</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Linux</h2>
<p><a name="linux"></a></p>
<p>In Linux distributions the <strong>gcc</strong> compiler and <strong>make</strong> tool needed by
exercise packages are usually installed by default. However you should
to ensure that the check framework, zip and unzip, gdb and valgrind are
also installed, typing the following in the terminal (assuming you
have admin rights to the machine, and you are using either Debian or
Ubuntu distribution):</p>
<table class="codehilitetable"><tr><td class="linenos"><div class="linenodiv"><pre>1
2
3
4</pre></div></td><td class="code"><div class="codehilite"><pre>sudo apt-get install check
sudo apt-get install pkg-config
sudo apt-get install valgrind
sudo apt-get install gdb
</pre></div>
</td></tr></table>

<p>Many of these packages might already be installed in your system, in
which case you'll get a note about that. If you need to fetch and
submit packages as zip package (not recommended), you'll need to
install '<strong>zip</strong>' and '<strong>unzip</strong>' as well.</p>
<p>If you want to use Netbeans, see <a href="#nb-install">below</a> for installation
instructions.</p>
<h2>Mac OS</h2>
<p><a name="macos"></a></p>
<p>In Mac OS, the C compilers come from the XCode package that can be
installed from app store. In addition you'll need command line tools
for development.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In Mac OS X Mountain Lion (10.8) these can be downloaded using <a href="https://developer.apple.com/downloads/index.action?=Command%20Line%20Tools%20%28OS%20X%20Mountain%20Lion%29#">this
  package</a></a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In Mac OS C Mavericks (10.9) these can be installed by typing
  <code>xcode-select --install</code> in Terminal window, and
  following the instructions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mac OS Yosemite (10.10) has not yet been tested by the course staff,
  but you'll similarly need C compiler for it. Possibly it happens the
  same way as with Mavericks.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You will need a package manager to install additional required
packages. Howebrew is one such manager, and below instructions are
made for it.</p>
<p>Open Terminal window. You can install Homebrew by typing</p>
<table class="codehilitetable"><tr><td class="linenos"><div class="linenodiv"><pre>1</pre></div></td><td class="code"><div class="codehilite"><pre>ruby -e &quot;$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/go/install)&quot;
</pre></div>
</td></tr></table>

<p>Follow the instructions on the screen. More information about Homebrew
is available <a href="http://brew.sh">here</a>. When everything is
done, start installing the needed packages:</p>
<table class="codehilitetable"><tr><td class="linenos"><div class="linenodiv"><pre>1
2</pre></div></td><td class="code"><div class="codehilite"><pre>brew install check
brew install pkg-config
</pre></div>
</td></tr></table>

<p>Unfortunately, setting up gdb and valgrind on recent versions of Mac
may be more complicated, but there are instructions for example
<a href="http://wiki.lazarus.freepascal.org/GDB_on_OS_X_Mavericks_and_Xcode_5">here</a>.</p>
<p>In Mavericks (OS X 10.9), if you want to use these tools from NetBeans
or some other GUI application, you'll need to set the required paths
for the GUI applications by adding the following line to
<code>/etc/launchd.conf</code>. One way to do this is to type the
following three lines in the terminal command prompt (the first will
ask your password):</p>
<table class="codehilitetable"><tr><td class="linenos"><div class="linenodiv"><pre>1
2
3</pre></div></td><td class="code"><div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="x">sudo su</span>
<span class="x">echo &quot;setenv PATH </span><span class="p">$</span><span class="nv">PATH</span><span class="x">&quot; &gt;&gt;/etc/launchd.conf</span>
<span class="x">exit</span>
</pre></div>
</td></tr></table>

<p>After modifying <strong>launchd.conf</strong>, you'll need to restart machine for
the path change to take effect.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the above does not work with Yosemite (OS X 10.10), but
the Netbeans should work properly if started from command
line, by typing</p>
<p><code>/Applications/NetBeans/NetBeans\ 8.0.1.app/Contents/MacOS/netbeans</code></p>
<p>The exact name may differ based on version number. The course staff
does not own Yosemite systems, so the above has not been tested.</p>
<p>For installing Netbeans, see <a href="#nb-install">below</a>.</p>
<h2>Windows</h2>
<p><a name="win"></a></p>
<p>Since with Cygwin we can't guarantee smoot flawless experience, we higly recommend using the <a href="#virtualbox">VirtualBox image with Ubuntu and TMC-NetBeans installed</a> for working on the exercise.</p>
<p>We have the installation for windows outlined below, and running exercises usually works, however, there are known issues regarding the lack of windows support.</p>
<p>Download Cygwin from <a href="http://www.cygwin.com">www.cygwin.com</a>.  On the
web page, click "Install Cygwin" link, and choose either 32-bit or
64-bit version of Cygwin, based on your system architecture. You can
find this information in the Control panel's system information, but
if you are unsure, choose 32-bit version. Click the setup-*.exe link
corresponding to either of this versions, to download the
executable. After downloading, click the file to run it.</p>
<p>Various dialogs appear asking for configuration information. Unless
you want to change the default settings, just click "Next" through
them, until you see a window for selecting packages to install. You'll
need to choose the following packages. Click on top of "Skip" on the
list to select it to be installed.</p>
<ul>
<li>Devel/gcc-core -- for the C compiler and related tools</li>
<li>Devel/make -- for the make tool that the exercise packages use</li>
<li>Devel/pkg-config -- needed by the tester tool</li>
<li>Devel/check -- needed by the tester tool</li>
<li>Devel/gdb -- for debugging your C programs</li>
<li>Archive/unzip -- for extracting zip packages downloaded from TMC server</li>
<li>Archive/zip -- for creating zip packages for TMC submission</li>
</ul>
<p>After pressing "Next", the installer may recommend additional packages
needed for dependencies, and in this case you should just click "Next"
until the downloading and installing starts. This will take a while.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, because check does not appear to work perfectly in
Windows, the local TMC tests fail in some (many) cases. The easiest
advise for Windows users is to submit code to server for
checking. Before submitting, check that the code compiles without
errors or warnings, and do some your own tests by modifying src/main.c
to see that your code behaves as you expect.</p>
<h2>Using the command line client (tmc-cli) for building and checking code</h2>
<p><a name="tmc-cli-install"></a></p>
<p>If you do not use Netbeans, you can interact with TMC and submit
exercises with the <strong>tmc-cli</strong> command line client. For command line
client you need to have a recent Java installed (java 8 should at least be fine)</p>
<p>Installing the tmc-cli on unix systems happens by downloading the executable from 
https://github.com/testmycode/tmc-cli/releases/latest and giving it execution permissions.
After first run, it'll add it to your <code>.bashrc</code> and will be accessible like other binaries.</p>
<p>After installing, you should use 'tmc login -s https://tmc.mooc.fi/mooc' to set up the server
address and your login details. <strong>It is important to set up the server
URL properly</strong>, to <code>https://tmc.mooc.fi/mooc</code>. Username
and password are the same you used when creating TMC account.
Select also the correct course you are participating.</p>
<p>The full usermanual can be viewed here: https://github.com/testmycode/tmc-cli#tmc-cli</p>
<p>The most common tmc commands you will need are the following (see
<a href="https://github.com/testmycode/tmc-cli#tmc-cli">instructions</a>
for more information):</p>
<ul>
<li><code>tmc download</code>: download exercise templates</li>
<li><code>tmc update</code>: check for updates in exercises and tests</li>
<li><code>tmc test</code>: test the currently selected exercise locally</li>
<li><code>tmc submit</code>: submit the currently selected exercise to TMC server.</li>
<li><code>tmc paste</code>: send the current exercise to TMC-pastebin.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Installing Netbeans and TMC plugin</h2>
<p><a href name="nb-install"></a></p>
<p>If you want to use Netbeans and TMC plugin, here are instructions on how to
install them. Before doing these, install the debugging and testing tools
following the above instructions on your respective operating system.</p>
<p>Netbeans needs JDK 7 that can be downloaded from
<a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html">this web site</a>.
Choose the right version based on you machine and download the package.
In Linux, choose .tar.gz package and extract it to a location of your choice.
For Windows and Mac there are installer packages that you'll need to run and
follow instructions.</p>
<p>After installing JDK, download Netbeans IDE from <a href="https://netbeans.org/downloads/">netbeans.org</a>. Note: The TMC plugin used in this course requires Netbeans version 8.0 or higher. Unfortunately many package managers, e.g. in Ubuntu, include an earlier version, so you'll need to download NetBeans manually. <strong>Important: there are multiple variants available on Web page. Install a variant that supports C/C++.</strong> You will get an installer package (e.g. netbeans-8.0.1-cpp-linux.sh) that you'll need to run to install NetBeans.</p>
<p>After successfully installing Netbeans and launching it for the first time, you can install the TMC plugin. Here is a short summary how to do this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to "Tools" menu, choose "Plugins" menu item. A window opens.</li>
<li>Click "Settings" tab on the top of the window, click "Add" button on the right side of the window. A dialog opens.</li>
<li>Type "TMC" to the name field. Type (or copy-paste)
  "http://update.testmycode.net/tmc-netbeans_mooc/updates.xml" to the URL field. Click "OK".</li>
<li>The dialog closes. Click the available plugins tab (second from left). Type "tmc" to the search field on top right part of the window and press enter. Only one entry, for "Test My Code plugin" should show up. Click the install checkbox on the plugin, and press "Install" button on bottom left of the window.</li>
<li>Plugin installer dialog shows up. Click next and agree with the license agreement. Press "Install" button once more on bottom right.</li>
<li>There may be warnings about unsigned plugins, but just click continue (trust me).</li>
<li>If Netbeans proposes to restart, do so.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you restart Netbeans, a new dialog should show up for configuring
the TMC plugin. If it does not open automatically, you can open it by
going to "TMC" menu on top, and choosing the "Settings" menu item. In
the dialog, type the username and password you
used for creating TMC account.
Also verify that server address is <strong>https://tmc.mooc.fi/mooc</strong> (should be correct by default). Choose the correct course (you may need to press "Refresh list" button).</p>
<h3>Troubleshooting</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Sometimes the buttons to run local tests or submit the tests turns gray</strong>. The most common reasons for this is 1) you have not selected the correct project on the project panel in the left side of the window. Click on the correct exercise set; 2) you have not logged in properly (for example, have mistyped password).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>If an error with '401' or '403' code appears</strong>, the most likely reason is that your username or password is wrong.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>When pressing Run - button, Netbeans executes the test executable.</strong> If this happens, you can set the executable in the following way: Go the Project Properties in File menu. Choose "Run" page from the window that opens. Under this page, find "Run Command" setting, and change that to "src/main" (instead of default value ${OUTPUT_PATH}).</p>
</li>
</ul>

    <div class="content-block" id="04_model">
    <h1 class="content-title">The Exercise model</h1>
    <div class="content-body">
    
      <p><a name="model"></a></p>
<p>The exercises are packaged into software projects that are downloaded
from the TMC site. For larger exercises there is single project
package per exercise, but sometimes multiple small exercises are
combined into the the same package. The name of the project package
should indicated clearly the module and the task number(s) the package
contains.</p>
<p>Inside the package there are templates for the functions that are
described in the exercise description, and related files needed to
compile and build the code: Makefile, include headers, test framework
components, and a few others. The figure below shows the directory
hierarchy and the location of the most important files.</p>
<hr />
<div align="center"><img src="../static/pics/project_files.jpg" align="center"></div>

<hr />
<p>There is a top-level directory of the form "Module_X-Task_Y", where X and Y represent the module and task numbers. The exercise work mainly happens on files in "src" sub-directory. In the first exercises the functions that need to be implemented are in "source.c" file. In many cases, particularly in the beginning, there are placeholders for the function definitions, but their implementation is empty, and typically one function corresponds to one exercise (or its subtask). Sometimes there are additional completed functions you can (or need) to use in exercise, and sometimes there are functions that are half-ready, and you'll need to fix them. Your task is to fill in the implementations according to instructions. In some cases the name of the source file(s) can be different -- in this case this will be mentioned in the exercise description. "main.c" file can be used to test the functions you have implemented. It contains the main function where execution starts when you run your program. Usually there is an example implementation of the main function, but you can freely modify it to test different things. The main function is not investigated by the exercise testers. "source.h" contains the function definitions from source.c, and sometimes additional type declarations. "main" is the executable file that is created when you compile the source code successfully.</p>
<p>The "test" directory contains the code that tests your implementation. You do not need to touch this directory, but if you are interested, you can take a look at "test_source.c" to see how the functions are evaluated. The "nbproject" directory contains information needed by the Netbeans IDE. It is better not to touch it, particularly is you want to use Netbeans.</p>
<p>After you have done the exercise (or parts of it), the software project package with your modifications is uploaded back to the TMC server in a zip package. The server checks the exercises, and gives points for correctly completed exercises.</p>
<p>In short: <strong>in the first two modules src/source.c is usually the only file you must modify to complete exercise</strong>. It is also useful to also modify src/main.c to test your code in different ways before you submit it to server.</p>

      <h2>Netbeans</h2>
<p>Netbeans' TMC plugin automatically proposes to download the exercise
templates for you. If this does not work for some reason, you can
download them using the "Download/update exercises" menu item in TMC
menu. After they have been downloaded, you can find the exercise
projects in the left side of the window. You can navigate inside the
project by clicking the tick-mark on the left side of the project
name. Proceed in this hierarchy until you find src directory and files
source.c and main.c. In the first exercises, you need to implement the
function templates in file source.c. Double-clicking on the file name
opens the file in editor.</p>
<p>After you have written a piece of code, the first task is to check
that it compiles and does not result in compiler errors or
warnings. Click the hammer logo at the top of the Netbeans window to
compile the project (including all its C source files) and produce
executable. If compile is successful and does not result in errors, an
executable file titled "main" will be produced in the src
directory. If there are errors or warnings (at the bottom of the
window there is space for output), read the messages carefully and try
to fix your code accordingly, and try to compile the code
again. Repeat this until there are no more warnings and errors.</p>
<hr />
<div align="center"><img src="../static/pics/netbeans-buttons.jpg" align="middle"></div>

<hr />
<p>When the code compiles without warnings and errors, you can try to run
it using the green arrow on the right side of the build button. The
output will again be shown at the bottom of the Netbeans window. Check
that the output shows what you expected. Many programming errors are
such that the compiler does not catch them, but you only notice them
from unexpected output. If the output is not as you expected, try to
fix your code and recompile it, and then try running it again. <strong>Note:
in C programming, you always need to recompile your code after you
have modified the source. Otherwise the changes do not take effect in
the executable</strong>. Many IDEs automatically detect changes and recompile
code when needed, though, but it never hurts to be cautious about
this. The course exercise projects produce two executables: one for
the main.c under the src directory, that you can use for your own
testing, and another for the exercise testers. Sometimes, after
pressing the run button, Netbeans asks which one to run. Pick "main"
under the src directory in that case.</p>
<p>If you think the code works, you can use the TMC checker to see if it
agrees with you, by using the eye button on the right side of the
button panel. The checker performs different tests on the different
functions, and if everything gives correct result, it reports "Pass"
on the particular task. If there are errors, it reports "Fail". In
that case you'll need to figure out what is the problem (the test
gives you some output that hopefully helps), fix the code, recompile
it, and re-try the test. There is a separate test for each function
and task, and the green/red meter shows you how many percent of tests
in the current project you have passed.</p>
<p>When you are happy with your test results, you can submit your code to
TMC server using the rightmost button with upload arrow, that once
more checks the code and gives you points for successful tasks. After
this you are done with this group of tasks, and can move to next
project. It is also possible to upload the code even if not all tests
pass. You can do earn points for those tasks that worked. You can
always later resubmit the code, after completing more tasks.</p>
<p>TMC has a feature for requesting code reviews of the submitted
code. Because of the large number of students on the C course, <strong>this
feature is not in use</strong>. You can request a review, but it is unlikely
that anyone acts on it.</p>
<h2>Command line</h2>
<p>If you prefer to work on the command line, it is recommended that you
use <strong>tmc-cli</strong>, as described above. If this does not work for you for
some reason, an alternative is to submit exercises through the TMC web
interface.</p>
<p>Start by downloading zip package, and extracting it to a chosen place (e.g. using "unzip" in Linux terminal). Go to the project directory extracted from the zip (Module-_X/Task_Y), and edit "src/source.c" (or other source file, depending on the exercise) with your favorite text editor based on the assignments. when you want to test that the code compiles, you can type <code>make main</code> on the command line. As in the case of Netbeans IDE, check the compiler output, and if there are errors or warnings, fix the code and rebuild the code.</p>
<p>When there are no errors or warnings, you can run the code. You can do this by typing <code>make run-main</code>. Check if the output matches your expectations. If there was incorrect output, try to fix the code and recompile it after that.</p>
<p>If output looks correct, you can run the TMC tests locally by typing <code>make run-test</code>. For each test there is a line of output, that ends either in Pass or Fail. Typically there is one line of output for each task in the project file. If some tests result in failure, a message is provided that hopefully helps you solve the problem. In that case try to fix the code, and recompile it.</p>
<p>Once you are satisfied with the test results, you will create a zip package out of the project. Go up one level in the file hierarchy, and in Linux terminal type something like "zip -r project.zip Module_X-Task_Y" to create the package. The -r option is important, because it tells to recursively include subdirectories. You can upload the zip package in the TMC web interface, by choosing the appropriate exercise project from the list, and on the page that opens using "choose file" button to select your zip package, and then pressing "Submit". The system analyses your code for a while, and the gives output about the results. If everything went fine, you can move to next exercise project.</p>

    <h1 class="content-title">Installing VirtualBox image</h1>
    <div class="content-body">
    
      <p>There is a a VirtualBox image based on Ubuntu Linux 14.04 that has the
needed software readily installed, including the tools needed for
local checks and Netbeans with TMC plugin. If the native installation
does not work for you, you could try if the VirtualBox image does. The
downside of this approach is that the VirtualBox image is large: the
package you'll need to download is slightly over 3 GB, and when installed, the
virtual instance will take about 8 GB from your hard drive. On
execution, the instance also uses up to 1 GB of RAM, that may be
problem in small systems. Additionally, your hardware should support
virtualization (e.g., through AMD-V or Inter VT-x), otherwise
executing the virtual instance is very slow. In some systems these are
disabled by default, but can be enabled in BIOS. In modern systems
Virtualbox should work fairly well, though.</p>
<p>The VirtualBox image can be <a href="http://mooc.tmchq.co/mooc.ova">downloaded
here</a> (3.5 GB). Unfortunately the
current image does not have tmc-cli pre-installed but you can easily
install it yourself, based on tmc-cli installation
instructions.</p>
<p>You can download VirtualBox software from their <a
href="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads">web site</a>. Follow
the instructions to install it from the package. Once installed you
need to import the Virtual Box image you downloaded, named
"mooc.ova", using the "Import Appliance" menu item from "File"
menu. A dialog appears, in which you should click "Ok" or "Continue"
to proceed with installing the image. After installation, it will
appear on the left side of the main window. Click "mooc" item
and press "Start" on the top of the window. A new window opens where
virtual Linux instance starts to boot up.</p>
<p>The username for the virtual Linux system is "mooc", and the
password is "mooc". You do not need to separately login to the systems,
but sometimes you may need the password, for example if the Ubuntu
system wants to update existing software packages. You can launch the
Netbeans IDE from the icon on top left corner of the Linux
desktop. The virtualbox image already has the TMC plugin installed,
but you'll need to configure your TMC username and password in the
Settings dialog you can find from the "TMC" menu. More detailed
instructions are same as above in the Netbeans installation section.</p>
<p>You can use the command line also with the VirtualBox
image. Just open the terminal window (see icon on the left), and
follow instructions above. You don't need to install Check or
Valgrind, they are already available in the virtual instance.</p>

    <div class="content-block" id="07_pastebin">
    <h1 class="content-title">Pastebin</h1>
    <div class="content-body">
    
      <p>If you have problem with your code you cannot solve, you can send it
to pastebin at the TMC server so that the course assistants can see
it, and possibly help with your problem. <strong>Note: also other students
who have already solved the particular exercise package can see the
pastebin post</strong> (and possibly help). After submitting to pastebin, you
will get an URL that you can copy and paste for example to IRC.</p>
<p>If you are using Netbeans, pick "Send code to TMC pastebin" from TMC
menu. A window opens, where you can supply a comment or question. Then
press "Send", and you will get a link back that you can copy to IRC
(or Email).</p>
<p>If you are using <strong>tmc-cli</strong>, you can type <code>tmc paste</code> to
submit the currently selected exercise to pastebin.</p>
<p>If you are using neither Netbeans or tmc.py, you'll need to go to TMC
server, choose the correct exercise and select the zip package that
contains your code. Before submitting, click "Submit to pastebin"
checkbox. You will get a submission confirmation page. Click "View
submitted files" and use the resulting URL as your pastebin URL.</p>

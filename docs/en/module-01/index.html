<p>Acknowledgments: the TMC developers (Matti Luukkainen, Jarmo
    Isotalo, Tony Kovanen, Martin Pärtel) have been of great help in
    setting up and maintaining the TMC system. Some of the course
    material and examples are based on the earlier version of the
    course by Raimo Nikkilä. The past and present course assistants
    (including Riku Lääkkölä, Konsta Hölttä, Essi Jukkala, Tero
    Marttila) have fixed errors and otherwise improved the content and
    exercises.</p>

<h2>Foreword</h2>
<p>This material is not intended as a complete reference about C, but
just aims to contain sufficient information to get started with C
programming. For additional and more complete information, it is
recommended that you get a book that contains additional details about
various aspects. A very commonly used reference is <strong>"The C Programming
Language"</strong> by Brian W. Kernighan and Dennis M. Ritchie (currently at
its 2nd edition). In this material we typically refer to this book by
just as "the K&amp;R book".</p>
<p>An important part of the course (and generally, in learning C) is to do
small programming exercises that are embedded within this
material. The exercises are designed so that if you have read the text
from the beginning without jumping around, you should be able to do
the exercise with the information you have read until that
point. Therefore, when you encounter an exercise, you could stop
reading and try to do the exercise.</p>
<p>Doing the exercises follow roughly the following cycle (see
<a href="../instructions/index.html">Instructions</a> for more details):</p>
<ol>
<li>Write some code in editor</li>
<li>Compile the code using the Makefiles provided. If there are
 compile errors or warnings, resolve those by modifying your code,
 until no errors or warnings are produced by compiler.</li>
<li>Execute and test the code by running src/main in exercise
 directory. If something works in unexpected way, go back to 1.</li>
<li>Run local TMC tests (may not work in Windows). If there are
 failures, try to figure out what is wrong and go back to 1.</li>
<li>If local tests passed, submit your code to the <a
href="https://src.aalto.fi/tmc/">TMC server</a>. If those tests
 passed, you have completed the exercise. Note that the server may
 implement different tests than the local checker. If there were
 failures, jump back to 1.</li>
</ol>
<p>There will be about 70-80 exercises altogether in the course, so the
above process will become familiar to you.</p>
<p><strong>Happy hacking!</strong></p>
<h2>Introduction to C</h2>
<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)">wikipedia article</a> on C language gives a succinct summary of the
relevant properties of C, and its relationship to other common
programming languages.</p>
<p>C program consists of (usually several) functions, written on one or
more text-based source code files. These files are processed by a
compiler and linker that produce a binary executable file understood
by the underlying computer. While the text-based C programs are
intended to be portable, i.e., the same code should work in different
computers, the binary executable is specific to the architecture it
was compiled for (for example, Intel-based 64-bit Linux). When moving
the program code to a different machine, it therefore needs to be
recompiled for that machine. Also, every time you modify the source
code, you will need to recompile it. This is a significant difference
to higher-level interpreted languages, such as Python.</p>
<p>Building an executable from C source code happens in the following
distinct phases, in the following order:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Preprocessor</strong>: 
    processes macros, inclusion of header files, conditional 
    compile instructions, etc, to prepare the source code 
    for actual compiling into binary code.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Compiler</strong>: 
    compiles the preprocessed, text-based code 
    into native binary object code. The object code still contains
    symbols for external references (for example, functions 
    implemented in other libraries), and cannot be executed as
    such. If a C program is split into multiple source code files,
    a separate object file (with .o suffix) is produced from each
    source code file (marked with .c suffix).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Linker</strong>: 
    links together the different object files and resolves the 
    references, producing the actual executable that can be 
    run in the system.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Typically a C compiler, such as <strong>gcc</strong> performs all of the above
steps. For example, typing <code>gcc -o exec source1.c source2.c</code> on a
command line shell reads source files <strong>source1.c</strong> and <strong>source2.c</strong>,
executes the above three steps on them, and produces a binary
executable called "exec", that can be run on the command
line. However, by using different command line options, the gcc
compiler can be instructed to perform only a selection of the above
phases.</p>
<p>In addition to source code files with .c suffix, a C program usually
uses header files with .h suffix. These contain definitions of data
types and functions needed by the C program, and they enable using
definitions that are external to a particular source code file. A C
program takes these definitions into use with a series of <strong>#include</strong>
preprocessor directives that are located in the beginning of a C
source code file.</p>
<p>There are two kinds of header files: user-defined headers and the
headers needed for using system libraries. The #include directive
format differs a bit in these two cases (e.g., <code>#include
"source.h"</code> vs. <code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;</code>). During
the first module you don't need to mind about these much -- the
exercise templates contain the necessary include statements.</p>
<p>There are different ways of working with the C code. You can edit the
source code files using a separate text editor such as <strong>kate</strong>,
<strong>emacs</strong> or <strong>vi</strong> (all installed in Aalto Linux systems), and use
the command line shell to compile and test the code. Alternatively,
you can use an Integrated Development Environment (IDE), that has an
integrated graphical user interace for editing code, compiling it,
debugging it, and so on. Using either of these alternatives are
possible on this course. See the <a
href="instructions.html">Instructions</a> for more details.</p>

<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>

<p>The first line tells that the program uses the definitions for
"Standard I/O" functions provided by the standard library. This header
is needed, for example, for printing text on the screen. We will look
into these functions in more detail later.</p>
<p>Every executable C program must have the <strong>main function</strong> that the system
calls when the program execution is started. In the above example,
line 3 starts the main function.</p>
<p>The definition of the function is included in a block enclosed with
braces (from line 3 to 7), and consists of one or (usually) more
<strong>statements</strong>. Each statement <strong>ends with a semicolon</strong>. In this
example we only have one statement on line 6, calling the <strong>printf</strong>
function that outputs text on screen. On line 5 there is a descriptive
comment enclosed inside <code>/*</code> and <code>*/</code> markers. Such comments can
contain any free-form text, and are intended for programmer to leave
clarifying notes for the reader of the code. Compiler ignores anything
inside the comment marks.</p>
<p>The '<strong>printf</strong>' function shown in the example outputs text on the
screen. It is defined in the Standard I/O library, which is why we had
to begin the program with the <code>#include</code> directive. In this example
the printf function contains one parameter (inside parenthesis), which
is a string that is written to the screen. The string ends with a
newline character (<code>\n</code>), causing the following output to be printed
on the next line. The '<strong>printf</strong>' function call, like all other C
statements, ends in semicolon (;). Forgetting the semicolon is a
common mistake for beginners that causes compilation of source code to
fail.</p>
<p>As you might guess, the program prints <em>"Hey! How are you?"</em> on the
screen. You can try this program by yourself to practice the use of
compiler.</p>
<p>C is liberal about the formatting of the source code.  The spaces or
line feeds in the code do not affect the program logic. In extreme
case the whole program could be written on a (very long) single
line. However, even though the C compiler does not care about
formatting, it is important to follow clear and consistent programming
style. Otherwise the program code is very difficult to read. Some
rules of thumb for clear style:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Indent code</strong> based on program blocks: whenever a new block of
    statements is started, indent the start of the line by a
    consistent space. Always use consistent spacing (for example 4
    spaces for every indent, or one tab for every indent)</li>
<li>apply clear and <strong>consistent style in naming</strong> of variables and
    functions. They should be descriptive enough, but
    very_long_local_variable_names are usually not a good idea.</li>
<li>divide program in logical, not-very-long <strong>functions</strong>, instead of
    writing everything in the main function.</li>
<li><strong>use comments</strong> to explain logic that might not be easy to follow for
    someone else by just reading the code.</li>
</ul>
<p>Text editors, especially in IDEs, often try to assist the programmer in following consistent style, for example by applying indentation automatically (sometimes to the point of irritation, if the programmer disagrees with the style).</p>
<p>Let's try the first exercise, as described below.</p>

        <div class="content-block" id="03_types">
    <h1 class="content-title">Data Types and Variables</h1>
    <div class="content-body">
    
      <p>In C (and many other programming languages) data is stored in
<strong>variables</strong>. Each variable has a name and a data type that
determines what values can be stored in the variable. C applies
<em>static type checking</em>, meaning that compliance to declared data types
is checked already at the compile time. Therefore, before a variable can
be used, <strong>it must be declared</strong> with an indication of its data
type.</p>
<p>The variable names in C are case-sensitive. The name can consists of
alphabetic characters, numbers and underline (_), but must not start
with number. These naming rules apply all different types of names in
C: functions, data types, and so on.</p>
<h2>Integer data types</h2>
<p>Integers are perhaps the most common data type in C (although this
depends on the application area). There are different types of
integers in C, differing in the amount of memory space they require,
and consequently the number range they can represent. The integer data
types are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>char</strong> -- size: 8 bits (1 byte), signed values from -127 to 127, unsigned values from 0 to 255.</li>
<li><strong>short int</strong> -- 16 bits (2 bytes), signed values from -32767 to 32767, unsigned values from 0 to 65535</li>
<li><strong>int</strong> -- at least 16 bits, typically 32 bits (4 bytes), signed values from -(2<sup>31</sup> - 1) to 2<sup>31</sup> - 1, unsigned values from 0 to 2<sup>32</sup> - 1</li>
<li><strong>long int</strong> -- at least 32 bits, can be 64 bits (8 bytes)</li>
<li><strong>long long int</strong> -- 64 bits, signed values from -(2<sup>63</sup> - 1) to 2<sup>63</sup> - 1, unsigned values from 0 to 2<sup>64</sup> - 1</li>
</ul>
<p>For each basic data type, a declaration can be contain <code>signed</code>
and <code>unsigned</code> keywords (before the actual type), to specify whether
the data type is intended for only positive values, or also for
negative values. If this is not specified, the default is to apply
signed type, except in the case of char, where the default behavior is
implementation dependent. Unfortunately, the basic integer types do
not always have the same range, and for example in the old
implementations the size of <strong>int</strong> type can be shorter than in modern implementations.</p>
<p>For <code>long int</code> and <code>short int</code> a shorter form of <code>long</code> and <code>short</code>
can be (and are usually) used.</p>
<p>Below are examples of few variable declarations. When a variable is
declared, it can be set to have an initial value, or it can be left
uninitialized. <strong>If a variable is not initialized, its initial value
is unknown</strong>, and results in unpredictable program behavior. Therefore
it is recommended to initialize the variable when declaring it, when
possible.</p>

<p>The above example also shows another way of using comments: a single
line comment can start with two slashes (//). Such comment ends at the
end of line. Because C is liberal about formatting, we can add a
comment on the same line with other code.</p>
<p>One problem with the basic data types presented above is that the
exact size of the variable can differ between architectures. The C99
standard also includes new, fixed size integer definitions that
improve the portability of programs between architectures. These are
defined in the <code>stdint.h</code> header, and are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>uint8_t, int8_t</strong>: unsigned and signed 8-bit integer</li>
<li><strong>uint16_t, int16_t</strong>: unsigned and signed 16-bit integer</li>
<li><strong>uint32_t, int32_t</strong>: unsigned and signed 32-bit integer</li>
<li><strong>uint64_t, int64_t</strong>: unsigned and signed 64-bit integer</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Constants</strong> are fixed values defined by the programmer when writing
the code. By default integer constants assume <strong>int data type</strong>, i.e.,
they can represent a 32-bit value range in modern systems. Above we
saw constants -50, 200, 500 and 100000. By default constants follow
the decimal (base 10) number system, but there is a representation
format for giving octal (base 8) constants, and for giving hexadecimal
(base 16) constants. Octal constants start with digit 0. Hexadecimal
constants are prefixed with <code>0x</code>. In the early parts of the course
operating with decimal numbers is sufficient, but later we take a
closer look at hexadecimal notation. Below are examples of each of
these notations.</p>
<table class="codehilitetable"><tr><td class="linenos"><div class="linenodiv"><pre>1
2
3</pre></div></td><td class="code"><div class="codehilite"><pre>short a = 012; /* set variable a to octal 012, equal to decimal 10 */`
short b = -34; /* just using decimal number here */`
short c = 0xffff; /* hexadecimal constant, equal to decimal 65535 */`
</pre></div>
</td></tr></table>

<p>If constant for long data type is needed, 'L' needs to be added to the
end of the number: <code>long la = 10000000000L;</code>.</p>
<p>Even though C is statically typed, the types are not strictly
enforced, and the type of a value is implicitly converted when, for
example, assigning integer constant into <strong>char</strong> type
variable. For example, assigning value 1000 to <strong>char</strong> variable is possible,
but as it is likely incorrect code, the compiler will warn about
this. If programmer ignores this warning, the actual value of the
variable will become equivalent to the 8 lowest bits of decimal 1000,
which is a different number.</p>
<h2>Floating point numbers</h2>
<p>For presenting large numbers, or fractions of integers, floating point
data types can be used. Internally, a floating point number is built
from three components: the sign bit, significand, and exponent. The
number is then composed of these three parts in the following way:</p>
<p>number = (-1)<sup>sign</sup> * 1.significand * 2<sup>exponent</sup></p>
<p>Because of the way how floating point numbers are stored in binary
memory, the floating point numbers cannot cover a continuous number
space. Therefore floating point calculation operations do not always
give an exactly correct results, but sometimes a value "close" to the
correct result comes out. In addition, typically computation with
floating point numbers is slower than with integers. Therefore
integers are often used in C, and floating point numbers are only used
when the integer value range is not sufficient. Additional details can
be found in a related <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating_point">Wikipedia
article</a>.</p>
<p>There are three floating point data types, differing in how many bits
are allocated to the above three components:</p>
<ul>
<li>float -- 32 bits (1b + 23b significant + 8b exponent)</li>
<li>double -- 64 bits (1b + 52b significant + 11b exponent)</li>
<li>long double -- 80 or 128 bits</li>
</ul>
<p>The constants for floating point numbers can either use the conventional decimal format (e.g., 1.543), or exponent format (1e-2), or combination of both. The default data type for floating point constant is <strong>double</strong>, but if the constant is suffixed by 'F', it is assumed to be of type <strong>float</strong>. For example:</p>
<table class="codehilitetable"><tr><td class="linenos"><div class="linenodiv"><pre>1

</pre></div>

<h2>String and character constants</h2>
<p>String constants are included in double quotes, as we saw together
with the <strong>printf</strong> call in the first example. Operating with strings
in C requires understanding arrays and pointers, and therefore we
defer that to Module 2 for now.</p>
<p>The characters shown to user in C follow the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII">ASCII encoding
scheme</a>. There are also various
other encoding schemes, but the common property in all of them is that
each visible character has a numeric character code. For example, in
ASCII, letter 'A' is stored similarly as decimal number 65 in the
system memory, but shown as 'A' when printed to the screen as
character. C supports character constants to make it easier to operate
with ASCII-encoded characters. Character constants are
included in apostrophes ('):</p>
<p><code>int char_A = 'A';</code></p>
<p>It is important to make distinction between string constants ("text")
and character constants ('t'), because they stand for different data
type. The character constants are of <strong>int</strong> type, similar to normal
integer constants, and strings are arrays of <strong>char</strong> variables (as
will be discussed in Module 2)</p>
<p>Note that constants '1' and 1 are different in C: '1' is same as
decimal number 49 according to the ASCII system, whereas 1 is just
decimal number 1, but is nothing relevant interpreted as ASCII. Both
are integers nonetheless.</p>
<h2>Arithmetic operators</h2>
<p>Above we have seen cases of <strong>assignment operator</strong> (=) when
initializing the variables together with declaration. Assignment can
also be done separately of the declaration, and an earlier used
variable can be re-assigned -- after the following three lines,
variable <strong>var</strong> has value 20:</p>
<table class="codehilitetable"><tr><td class="linenos"><div class="linenodiv"><pre>1
2
3</pre></div></td><td class="code"><div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">var</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="n">var</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="n">var</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">20</span><span class="p">;</span>
</pre></div>
</td></tr></table>

<p>Operators <strong>+ (plus), - (minus), * (multiply), / (divide) and %
(modulus)</strong> are used as normal mathematical operators. As customary, +
and - have lower precedence than *, / and % (i.e., the latter are
evaluated first, regardless of their position in the expression). The
modulus operator can only be applied for integers, but the others work
for both floating point numbers and integers. Parenthesis can be used
to control the precedence (order of computation) as taught in
school. Here are a few examples:</p>
<table class="codehilitetable"><tr><td class="linenos"><div class="linenodiv"><pre>1
2
3
4</pre></div></td><td class="code"><div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="kt">float</span> <span class="n">fa</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mf">5.0</span> <span class="o">/</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="cm">/* using &#39;5.0&#39; to distinguish float constant from integer constant */</span>
<span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">ia</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">5</span> <span class="o">/</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="cm">/* different result than above because this is integer; */</span>
<span class="kt">char</span> <span class="n">cb</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">3</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="kt">long</span> <span class="n">lc</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">cb</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="n">fa</span><span class="p">;</span>
</pre></div>
</td></tr></table>

<p>The above example also shows that multiple operators and expressions
can be used to form a single statement -- here together with variable
declaration and its initialization.</p>
<p>C provides an alternative unary way for incrementing or decrementing
the value of a variable by one, by using increment and decrement
operators. These operators take either postfix or prefix form. In
postfix form, <code>a++</code> increments value of a by one, and <code>a--</code> decrements
the value of a by one. In prefix form, these operators are <code>++a</code> and
<code>--a</code>. The functionality in postfix and prefix formats is not
completely equivalent: in postfix form the value of the expression is
evaluated before the adjustment to the variable takes place, but in
prefix form the value is evaluated after the adjustment. This can have
significance when the unary increment/decrement operator is used as
part of a longer expression.</p>
<p>Another alternative is to use assignment operators, such as <code>a += 2</code> which is equivalent <code>a = a + 2</code>. The assignment operator formant works for all above arithmetic operators.</p>
<p>Below example shows these operators in use:</p>
<table class="codehilitetable"><tr><td class="linenos"><div class="linenodiv"><pre>1

    <span class="n">varA</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="cm">/* value is set to 10 */</span>
    <span class="n">varA</span><span class="o">++</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="cm">/* value is 11 */</span>
    <span class="n">varA</span> <span class="o">*=</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="cm">/* value is 22 */</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>
</td></tr></table>

<h2>Type conversions</h2>
<p>Because C can do implicit type conversions between variables, there
can be multiple data types as part of single expression. When larger
data type is converted into a smaller one, the excess high-order bits
are dropped, and therefore the value may change. When float is
assigned into integer, the decimals will be truncated.</p>
<p>Conversions can be forced explicitly using a <strong>type cast</strong> by
including the intended data type before an expression in
parenthesis. Sometimes this can affect the outcome of the expression,
as happens in the following example:</p>
<table class="codehilitetable"><tr><td class="linenos"><div class="linenodiv"><pre>1
2
3</pre></div></td><td class="code"><div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="kt">float</span> <span class="n">f</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mf">1.5</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">f</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">f</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">b</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">int</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="n">f</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">int</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="n">f</span><span class="p">;</span>
</pre></div>
</td></tr></table>

<p>The above program causes the value of '<strong>a</strong>' to be 3, while value of
'<strong>b</strong>' is 2. The first assignment to variable '<strong>a</strong>' calculates 1.5
+ 1.5 = 3 (as floating point number), which is automatically converted
to integer as part of assignment operation to '<strong>a</strong>'. In the second
case (assignment to '<strong>b</strong>'), the value of '<strong>f</strong>' is first converted
to integer on both sides of the plus operation, which causes its value
to change from 1.5 to 1. After this the result becomes 2. Use of type
casts is normally not necessary in simple programs, but sometimes are
unavoidable.</p>

      <p>The C programs are organized in functions. A function contains a
single logical part of the program, and it can be called from other
functions of the program (or from within the function itself). Use of
functions enables reusing code: in a well designed program any
particular part of program logic only needs to be implemented once in
a single function, that is then called from other parts of the code.</p>
<p>Function has four main components: <strong>name, return value, argument
declarations, and the body of the function</strong>. Below is an example of a
simple function definition of function '<strong>square</strong>' that multiplies
argument '<strong>base</strong>' by itself and returns it as the result of the

<p>Line 1 above starts with the data type of the function return value
(here '<strong>int</strong>') that can be one of the data types introduced above
(there are also other data types that can be used, but more about
those later). Then comes the function name, '<strong>square</strong>'. The function
arguments are listed inside parenthesis. There can be multiple
arguments separated with comma, but here we only have one parameter,
'<strong>base</strong>' that has <em>int</em> data type.  Each argument must have data
type and a name. It is also possible that function does not have any
arguments. In such case <code>void</code> is used to represent an empty argument
list. This is the case with the <strong>main</strong> function on line 7.</p>
<p>After the function return value type, name, and arguments is the
definition of the function body, inside curly brackets. The '<strong>square</strong>'
function body is on lines 2 to 6, and the '<strong>main</strong>' function body is
on lines 8 to 13. As discussed earlier, the program execution always
starts from the main function, and each function body consists of one
or more statements that make the program logic.</p>
<p>The function arguments work like any other local variables inside the
function implementation. This can be seen in the '<strong>square</strong>' function
body, where the '<strong>base</strong>' argument is used in the expression that
multiplies the given argument by itself, and stores the result to
variable named '<strong>res</strong>'.</p>
<p>The result of the function is indicated by the <strong>return</strong> statement
(on line line 4 for the '<strong>square</strong> function). When program encounters
the <strong>return</strong> statement, it exits the function, and returns to the
point of the code where the function was called. At the same time the value
of the expression following the return statement is passed to the
caller of the function. For example, when the <strong>main</strong> function calls
the '<strong>square</strong>' function for the first time on line 9, the value of
variable '<strong>val</strong>' is set based on the result of the function. In this
case it will be 9. The return statement can be in any part of the
function definition, and there can be multiple return statements in
single function definition.</p>
<p>The main function calls the '<strong>square</strong>' function repeatedly three
times with different parameters. As can be seen, the parameter can be
any expression, not just a constant value. In such case, the
expression is evaluated first, and when the result is known, it is
passed to the function as an argument. Because a function call can be
as part of any expression, a function call can contain another function
call as a parameter, as can be seen on line 11. In such case the inner
function result is evaluated first, and the result is passed as
argument to the outer function. In this case we happen to use the
'<strong>square</strong>' function itself as parameter. What will be the value of
'<strong>val3</strong>' at the end of the program execution?</p>
<p>It is important to note that the local variables declared inside a
function definition are only visible inside the function (or more
generally, inside the block statement marked with curly
brackets). Therefore variable '<strong>res</strong>' declared in function
'<strong>square</strong>' cannot be used in the main function, nor can variable
'<strong>val</strong>' be used inside the '<strong>square</strong>' function. The only way to
pass information between the functions is by using the arguments, or
the return value. (It should be noted, though, that the C language
allows declaring variables outside the functions, in which case they
are <strong>global</strong>, and visible to all functions. Use of global variables
is discouraged, however, unless there is a very good and
well-justified reason for that).</p>
<p>Function does not need to have any return value. In such case <code>void</code>
is used in place of the return type on the function definition. In
such function, the return statement does not provide any value, and
can be omitted from the function. Functions <strong>can have several return
statements</strong>, to force early exit from the function under some given
conditions, and in such case return statement can be useful also when
there is not return value for the function.</p>

that are printed as part of the string. For example, the following

appear at the beginning of the next line. The printf function
interface is defined in include header 'stdio.h'. Therefore the

<p>The <em>printf</em> parameters are placed in the output string by using
<strong>formatting conversion specifications</strong>. In its basic form, a
conversion specification consists of a percent sign (%) and a letter
that indicates the type of conversion. The conversion specification is
replaced by the parameter given in the <em>printf</em> call. If there are
multiple parameters (separated by comma), <strong>multiple conversion
specifications need to be used</strong>. The number of conversion
specifications must be the same as the number of parameters in the
<em>printf</em> call. The type of conversion specification must be compatible
with the data type of the corresponding parameter. Here are some
conversion types:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>%d</strong>: int -- integer in decimal format</li>
<li><strong>%u</strong>: unsigned int -- unsigned integer in decimal format</li>
<li><strong>%o</strong>: unsigned int -- octal number</li>
<li><strong>%x, %X</strong>: unsigned int -- hexadecimal number, using either lowercase letters (former) or uppercase letters (latter)</li>
<li><strong>%c</strong>: int -- single character based on the used character encoding (e.g., ASCII), as discussed earlier with the character constants.</li>
<li><strong>%s</strong>: char* -- string. We will take a more detailed look into strings in the next module.</li>
<li><strong>%f</strong>: double -- floating point number (format: n.nnnnnn). Default number of decimals included in output is 6.</li>
<li><strong>%e, %E</strong>: double -- floating point number (format: n.nnnnnnE+-xx)</li>
<li><strong>%g, %G</strong>: double -- choose either %f or %e format, depending on the value of exponent.</li>
</ul>
<p>If percent sign needs to be printed in the string, <strong>'%%'</strong> is used to
distinguish from other formatting conversions.</p>
<p>The following adjustments can be made on the formatting specification
before one of the above letters, after the percent sign. Different
adjustments can be combined, but they need to be in the following
order:</p>
<ul>
<li>minus (-) (e.g. <code>%-4d</code>): align the output left of the available field, when the field length is specified.</li>
<li>plus (+) (<code>%+4d</code>): for numeric conversion types, always include sign (+ or -).</li>
<li>0 (%04d): for numeric conversion types with specified length, pad the field with leading zeros instead of space.</li>
<li>number (e.g. <code>%4d</code>): indicates the minimum length of the output field. If the output needs less characters than given here, empty space is added before the output, such that the conversion replacement takes this many characters. By default the output is aligned to the right end of this field.</li>
<li>period followed by number (<code>%4.1f</code>): for floating point numbers, the precision (number of decimals following the point)</li>
<li>h or l (<code>%ld</code>): specifies that the argument is interpreted as
short (h) or as long (l) form of the basic data type</li>
</ul>
<p>More details can be found, for example, in the K&amp;R book.</p>
<p>Below there are some examples about formatted output. The square
brackets are not part of the formatting specification, but we use them
to illustrate the width of the output field.</p>

<p>Line 11 above shows an example of using the unary increment operator
as the printf parameter. Because the increment operator is prefixed,
the increment is done before the value of expression is determined,
and the value of <strong>numA</strong> is 11 when the printf function is called. If
the parameter had been <code>numA++</code>, the call would have printed 10,
because the increment is done after the value of expression is
determined.</p>
<p>The printf call does not automatically start a new line. Multiple
consecutive printf outputs will be shown on a single line, unless
start of the new line is enforced by the '\n' special character. '\n'
is not shown to user, but has its own ASCII encoding (10), that tells
the console to change the line of output, and move to the beginning of
the next line. '\n' does not have to be at the end of the output
string, as above, but could be included in any place. Wherever it is,
a new line is started at that point, and the following character
appears on the beginning of the next line. Here are few of the special
characters:</p>
<ul>
<li>'\n': new line -- the following output appears on the next line.</li>
<li>'\': produces a single backslash</li>
<li>'\"': produces a quote sign (")</li>
<li>'\'': produces a single quote</li>
</ul>
<p>There are also some others that you can study from the K&amp;R book, or from
other material.</p>
<h2>Formatted input</h2>
<p><strong>scanf</strong> is another function defined in the standard I/O library
(stdio.h). It reads formatted user input, and applies similar
conversion specifications as printf (there are some differences
between the two in how e.g. long data types are handled, but for now
you can assume that they are roughly similar). Below is an example of
two scanf calls.</p>

<p>On lines 5-7 there are a few variable declarations. This time they are
not initialized, so their <strong>initial values are unpredictable</strong>. The
first <strong>scanf</strong> call (line 9) expects a single integer value from
user, and places it in variable 'a'. The function returns when user
has pressed 'enter' to start a new line. The second <em>scanf</em> call (line
10) expects from user two float values separated by comma, and places
them in variables 'b' and 'c'.</p>
<p>The scanf function has an integer return value, that in the above
example is stored in variables '<strong>ret_a</strong>' for the first call and
'<strong>ret_b</strong>' for the second call. The return value tells how many
fields were read successfully. If everything went correctly, the ret_a
should contain value 1 after the call, and ret_b should contain value
2 after the call. If user gave misformatted input, the return value
will be smaller, for example 0. Therefore checking for the return
value is recommended after the scanf call (you will see soon, how).  If
user had entered invalid input, the contents of variables <em>a, b</em> and
<em>c</em> could remain uninitialized. As with <strong>printf</strong>, the number of
scanf parameters following the string needs to match the number of
conversion specifications.</p>
<p>The <em>scanf</em> function <strong>stops reading</strong> if the formatting specification
does not match the given input, and returns the number or correctly
read parameters. For example, if there have been multiple values on a
single line of input, and one of them does not match the format
specification, the next call to <em>scanf</em> encounters the same input
again. <em>scanf</em> also <strong>ignores whitespace characters</strong> in the user
input. Whitespace characters are, for example <strong>space, tab</strong> and
<strong>newline</strong> characters. An exception to this rule is reading a
character using scanf (the '%c' formatting conversion): it accepts
also whitespace characters.</p>
<p>For basic data types the <em>scanf</em> parameters need the <code>&amp;</code> operator as
prefix. This relates to addresses and pointers that we will look at
more in module 2. For now, just include them in your <em>scanf</em> calls,
and assume that in near future you will know why.</p>

      <h2>Statements and blocks</h2>
<p>A function body consists statements that can contain expressions, and
each statement is terminated by semicolon. <strong>Compound statement</strong> is
is a group of statements that are separated by opening and closing
braces { and }. In terms of program structure, a compound statement
itself is a statement. Declarations that are done inside a compound
statement block, are only visible inside the block, similarly to
declarations done in the function definition (that can be seen as a
top-level compound statement).  Usually compound statement blocks are
used together with control functions of the program, such as in
if-conditions or loops, but it is possible (although not very common)
to use them just stand-alone. Here is an example to illustrate this:</p>

<p>The above example causes a compiler error on line 9, because variable
b is declared inside the inner block (lines 5 - 8), and is not
available on a level above it.</p>
<h2>Relational and logical operators</h2>
<p>Relational and logical operators <strong>result in either 1 or 0</strong>, depending on
whether the condition in the operator is true or false. The relational
operators are:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>&lt;</code> -- less than</li>
<li><code>&lt;=</code> -- less or equal than</li>
<li><code>&gt;</code> -- greater than</li>
<li><code>&gt;=</code> -- greater or equal than</li>
<li><code>==</code> -- equal (<strong>Important: notice the difference to assignment operator with one '='</strong>)</li>
<li><code>!=</code> -- not equal</li>
</ul>
<p>The following example illustrates the outcome of relational operators:</p>

</td></tr></table>

<p>In above example an integer value is first read to variable '<strong>a</strong>'
(the implementor has been lazy to not check the return value of the
<em>scanf</em> call). Then, variable '<strong>a_res</strong>' is set to the result of logical
operator <code>a &lt; 5</code>, and becomes either 0 or 1, depending on what user
gave as input. Line 7 demonstrates that the relational operators can
be used in expression as any other operator, and can therefore be
used, for example as function parameters. The <em>printf</em> function will
show 1 if user had typed '5', otherwise it will show 0. The user input
(red) and program output (black) from above code could be for example
following:</p>
<pre>
<font color="red">5</font>
a less than 5: 0
a equal to 5: 1</pre>

<p>In addition, there are logical operators for AND, OR and NOT:</p>
<ul>
<li>AND operator is <code>&amp;&amp;</code>: for example expression <code>(a &lt; 5 &amp;&amp; b &gt; 6)</code> is true if a is smaller than 5 AND b is greater than 6.</li>
<li>OR operator is <code>||</code>: for example <code>(a &lt; 5 || b &gt; 6)</code> is true if either a is smaller than 5 OR b is greater than 6.</li>
<li>NOT (unary) operator is <code>!</code> in front of an expression, and negates the outcome of the expression. For example !(a &lt; 5) says "a is not smaller than 5", i.e., it is greater or equal to 5.</li>
</ul>
<p>A common mistake is to confuse &amp;&amp; and || (the logical operators) with
&amp; and | (bitwise operations, explained in later modules), causing a
different outcome. Similarly, it is common to confuse == (equality)
with = (assignment). Because both the assignment and bitwise operators
can be used as part of expression, the compiler accepts both forms,
but use of wrong operator leads to wrong behavior.</p>
<h2>If and else</h2>
<p>The if-else structure can be used to implement decisions in the
program, as with most other programming languages. The structure is:</p>
<pre>
if (expression)
  statement-1
else
  statement-2</pre>

<p>If '<em>expression</em>' is true, statement-1 is executed. If it is false,
statement-2 is executed. In C language, <strong>any non-zero value of
expression is interpreted as true, and zero is interpreted as
false</strong>. "expression" can be any C expression, and can contain a
function call or technically even just constant value (which would not
make any sense in practice). Often relational or logical operators
are used here, but they do not have to be used. For example, assuming
integer variable a, statement <code>if (a)</code> would test whether variable a
contains a non-zero value. '<em>statement-1</em>' and '<em>statement-2</em>' must
either be terminated with semicolon, or they can be compound statements
indicated by curly braces. Here is a simple example:</p>

</td></tr></table>

<p>The input could be, for example, like this:</p>
<pre>
<font color="red">400 2</font>
days: 35  years: 3</pre>

<p>The above example does not use curly braces in the else - branch,
which therefore consists of only one statement. Forgetting curly
braces unintentionally could also cause buggy behavior. Therefore they
are often used for clarity even if they would contain just one
statement. The else branch is not mandatory, and can be left out, if
there is no viable alternative code to execute.</p>
<p>An if-else construct can have more than two parts: another <code>if</code>
statement can follow directly after <code>else</code>, and this can be repeated
any number of times, until including the final <code>else</code> in the end,
which is not mandatory. For example:</p>

<h2>Switch</h2>
<p>The <code>switch</code> statement is another way for doing multi-way decisions,
when the options are constant integers. The switch statement compares
an expression to constant labels, and in case of matching label
executes the following code. Here is an example that reads one
character from user, and evaluates whether it is one of a few
alternatives:</p>

<p>Pay attention to the differences between switch construct and if-else
construct. In the case of switch, multiple statements can follow each
<strong>case</strong> statement without enclosing them inside compound statement
(i.e., curly brackets). Usually after the last statement of each
branch there is a <code>break</code> statement that causes the program to jump
out of the switch processing, to the code that follows the ending
brace of the whole switch statement (we will see more about <code>break</code>
shortly). If break is not included, the execution would continue
through the next labels: for example, if break was removed from branch
'1' above, the program would print two lines of output when user typed
character '1'. While this property is a common reason for bugs in C
programs, it allows assigning multiple labels for a piece of code, as
is done for 'a', 'b' and 'c' above. Finally, a special label "default"
is used to match all cases. Usually a good habit is to include break
statement also after the final branch, even though it is logically
unnecessary. This helps avoiding bugs if program is extended later.</p>
<p>Remember: '1' is also a constant integer, based on the ASCII
character encoding table, and is equivalent to 49 in decimal
format. Number 1 and character '1' are different values:
<code>printf("%c\n", '1');</code> outputs 1, but <code>printf("%d\n", '1');</code> outputs
49, because the latter prints numeric value corresponding the
character constant, but former assumes character encoding.</p>
<p>Note that <em>switch</em> can always be replaced with series of if..else
if.. statements that perform the corresponding set of tests.</p>

input and output using scanf and printf.</p>
<p>Write function <code>void simple_math(void)</code> that asks three values from
the user: number, operator, and another number. Operator should be one
of the following characters: '+', '-', '*' or '/'. If some other
character is used as operator, the function should print "ERR"
(without quotes). The numbers should be float type. If user does not
type a valid number-operator-number combination, the function should
print "ERR". When valid input is given, the function performs the
calculation as given, and prints the result on the screen, using the
precision of one decimal:</p>

      <h2>While and do-while</h2>
<p>The <strong>while</strong> statement repeats a (compound) statement as long as the
specified expression is true (i.e., has non-zero value). Below is an example
of a simple loop that repeats until the value of a is 10 (or higher).</p>
<table class="codehilitetable"><tr><td class="linenos"><div class="linenodiv"><pre>1
2
3</pre></div></td><td class="code"><div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">;</span>  <span class="c1">// in this case it is important to initialize the variable</span>
<span class="k">while</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="n">a</span><span class="o">++</span><span class="p">;</span>
</pre></div>
</td></tr></table>

<p>The termination condition is tested before executing the
statement. Therefore it is possible that the statement is never
executed, if the termination condition is false from the beginning.</p>
<p>As always, the statement inside while loop can be a compound
statement, as in the following:</p>
<table class="codehilitetable"><tr><td class="linenos"><div class="linenodiv"><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6</pre></div></td><td class="code"><div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="k">while</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="n">printf</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;value of a is now %d</span><span class="se">\n</span><span class="s">&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">a</span><span class="p">);</span>
    <span class="n">a</span><span class="o">++</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>
</td></tr></table>

<p>If it is desired to test the termination condition after the
(compound) statement, a do-while construct can be used as follows:</p>
<table class="codehilitetable"><tr><td class="linenos"><div class="linenodiv"><pre>1
2
3
4
5</pre></div></td><td class="code"><div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">20</span><span class="p">;</span>

    <span class="n">printf</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;value of a is now %d</span><span class="se">\n</span><span class="s">&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">a</span><span class="p">);</span>
    <span class="n">a</span><span class="o">++</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span> <span class="k">while</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">);</span>
</pre></div>
</td></tr></table>

<p>Because in this example the initial value of 'a' is 20, it prints one
line before the termination condition is evaluated, and the loop is
terminated.</p>
<h2>For</h2>
<p><strong>for</strong> is another statement for constructing loops, and can be used
as a convenient alternative to while in many cases. It takes the form</p>
<pre>
for (expression_1; expression_2; expression_3)
      statement
</pre>

<p>The above <strong>for</strong> construct could be built using <strong>while</strong>, in which
case an equivalent pattern would be:</p>
<pre>
expression_1;
while (expression_2) {
     statement
     expression_3;
}
</pre>

<p><strong>expression_1</strong> initializes the for loop, <strong>expression_2</strong> is the
iteration check, and <strong>expression_3</strong> is the adjustment expression at
the end of the for loop. Again, any C expressions could be used in the
three places (even including function calls, etc.).</p>
<p>For example, the second of the above <code>while</code> examples could be written as:</p>
<table class="codehilitetable"><tr><td class="linenos"><div class="linenodiv"><pre>1
2
3
4</pre></div></td><td class="code"><div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">a</span><span class="p">;</span>

<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>
</td></tr></table>

<p>Any of the three expressions in the for statement can be omitted. Therefore, yet
another form for the above would be</p>
<table class="codehilitetable"><tr><td class="linenos"><div class="linenodiv"><pre>1
2
3
4
5</pre></div></td><td class="code"><div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">;</span>

    <span class="n">printf</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;value of a is now %d</span><span class="se">\n</span><span class="s">&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">a</span><span class="p">);</span>
    <span class="n">a</span><span class="o">++</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>
</td></tr></table>

<p>If the termination condition (expression_2) is omitted, it is always
considered to be true, making an endless loop, unless broken by some
other means such as using the <code>break</code> statement.</p>
<p>Multiple for loops can be nested, to form multidimensional loops.</p>
<p>C99 allows declaration of variables as part of the for-statement, in
<em>expression-1</em>.</p>
<h2>break and continue</h2>
<p>The <code>break</code> statement can be used to terminate a loop before the
specified condition is evaluated. For example, the below example never
makes it to 10, but stops counting at 5:</p>
<table class="codehilitetable"><tr><td class="linenos"><div class="linenodiv"><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6</pre></div></td><td class="code"><div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">a</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="k">for</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="n">a</span><span class="o">++</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="n">printf</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;value of a is now %d</span><span class="se">\n</span><span class="s">&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">a</span><span class="p">);</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">)</span>
        <span class="k">break</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>
</td></tr></table>

<p>The <code>continue</code> statement causes the next iteration of a loop to start
immediately. For example, the following code only shows the even
numbers (<code>a % 2</code> takes the modulo 2 out of variable a):</p>

how different displayed characters are mapped to numeric values, that can be
presented either as decimal or hexadecimal numbers.</p>
<p>Implement function <code>void ascii_chart(char min, char max)</code> that outputs
(a portion of) ASCII character mapping. It should iterate through numbers
starting from 'min' and ending to (and including) 'max'.</p>
<p>For each displayed item, the output should look like following:</p>

<p>three-character field that shows the given number (integer) in decimal
    format. If the number takes less than three characters (it is &lt; 100), it is
    aligned right.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>one space, followed by four-character field that shows the same number in

</li>
<li>
<p>one space, followed by the same number when printed in character format
    (always one-character field). The number is converted into a character
    according to ASCII coding system.</p>
<p>Some character codes are not "printable",
and do not produce sensible output with this formatting. For non-printable
characters, just '?' should be shown. You can use function <code>int isprint(int c)</code>
(<a href="http://linux.die.net/man/3/isprint" title="isprint manual page">man page</a>) to test if character in variable 'c' is printable.
If function returns 0, the character is not printable and should show as
'?'. If it is non-zero the character should be printed normally.</p>

            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> More playing with character manipulation, loops and use of
functions. Also, this works as a preliminary introduction to strings (actual
content in module 2).</p>
<p>Implement function <code>void secret_msg(int msg)</code> which decrypts (and encrypts) a given
message using a primitive algorithm (as described below). Each secret message
is identified by integer that is given as the parameter of this call ('msg').
You receive the message one character at a time by calling function <code>char
get_character(int msg, unsigned int cc)</code> that is given in the exercise
template. Implementation of that function contains some concepts introduced
only in Module 2 (arrays, strings), but you don't need to mind about them yet.
Just assume that the function returns character number 'cc' from message that
is numbered 'msg' (which is just the same value passed with the call to
secret_msg).</p>
<p>Character numbering starts from 0. You will need to call get_character multiple
times, by increasing the value of 'cc' by one for each call, until you receive
0 as the return value (i.e., cc is the character count from the beginning of
the message).</p>
<p>As you read the characters in message, you'll need to decrypt each of them at a
time and <strong>print the decrypted character to screen</strong>, until you reach the end
of the message (do not print the terminating 0).</p>
<p>The decryption algorithm is as follows: you decrement the received character
code from 158 (158 - code, where code is the value returned by get_character),
and the print the result as a character.</p>
<p>You can test this with messages numbered 0 and 1 that are provided in
src/main.c. If the function works, these messages should translate to readable
short sentences (in English). The TMC tests have also other message numbers.</p>

                Task 09-ships: Ship Sinker (4 pts)</h3>
        </div>

	<div class="panel-body">
	  
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Practice use of function calls as part of a (slightly)
bigger program</p>
<p>We will now implement a basic ship sinking game. Because it requires
features of C language that have not yet been discussed so far, part
of the functions are already given to you, and you will implement four
additional functions to complete the logic.</p>
<p>The game field is 10x10 squares, and each ship is 3 squares tall. The
coordinate range is between 0 and 9 both vertically and horizontally
(i.e., (0,0) is the upper left corner; (9,9) is the lower right).
The game ends when all ships are sunk.</p>
<p>The exercise code is divided into two c source files. <strong>shiplib.c</strong>
contains support functions for operating the game field. You will need
to call these functions in the exercise tasks, but you should not
modify this file. See the comments in the source code for explanations
about how this functions are used. <strong>ships.c</strong> contains the functions
you will need to implement.</p>
<p>You will need to implement four functions as follows. You will gain a
point for each of them, if implemented by the primary deadline.</p>
<h2>a) Place ships</h2>
<p>Implement function <code>void set_ships(unsigned int num)</code> that places
'<strong>num</strong>' ships to the game field. To place one ship at given
location, you should call function <strong>place_ship()</strong>, with the
location and direction of the ship (see source code for detailed
explanation). Note that <strong>place_ship()</strong> function fails if you try to
place ship to a location that overlaps with an existing ship, or goes
out of bounds, so you'll need to investigate its return value.</p>
<p><strong>Hint:</strong> You can use C library function
<strong><a href="http://linux.die.net/man/3/rand">rand()</a></strong> to pick a random
location and direction for a ship. The function returns a random
integer, which you can scale to the appropriate range using the
<em>modulo</em> operation (<code>%</code>). For example, <code>rand() % 10</code> produces random
numbers between 0 and 9.</p>
<h2>b) Print gamefield</h2>
<p>Implement function <code>void print_field(void)</code> that prints the whole
gamefield on screen. If a location <strong>is not</strong> yet visible to user, '?'
should be printed. If the location <strong>is</strong> visible (i.e., it has been
shot at already), there are three options to be printed:</p>
<ul>
<li>'.' if the location does not have a ship</li>
<li>'+' if the location has a part of a ship that has not yet been hit (when is
this needed?)</li>
<li>'#' if the location has a part of a ship that has been hit </li>
</ul>
<p>Initially all sectors are invisible, and a sector becomes visible
when the player shoots at it.</p>
<p>You will need to use two functions: <strong>is_visible(x,y)</strong> tells whether
the given sector is visible to the player. <strong>is_ship(x,y)</strong> tells
whether a location has a ship, and if it is hit. See the source code
comments at 'shiplib.c' for more detailed descriptions of these functions.</p>
<h2>c) Shoot</h2>
<p>Implement function <code>int shoot(void)</code> that asks two unsigned numbers from the
user, separated by space, that represent coordinates in the game
field. If user input is invalid or coordinates are out of bounds, the
function should return -1. If the given location has ship, the
function should call function <strong>hit_ship()</strong> to mark the location
hit, and return 1. If the given location does not have ship, the
function should return 0. In either case, the function should call
function <strong>checked()</strong> that marks the location visible.</p>
<h2>d) End of game</h2>
<p>Implement function <code>int game_over(unsigned int num)</code> that returns 1 if
all ships are sunk, or 0, if there are still ships to be hit. Parameter
'<strong>num</strong>' tells the number of ships on the game field. You know about
ships' status using the <strong>is_ship()</strong> function, and since you know
that each ship occupies 3 squares in game field, you can determine if
all ship positions have been hit.</p>

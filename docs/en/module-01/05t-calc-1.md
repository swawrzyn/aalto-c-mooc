# Task: Sum

**Objective:** practice use of formatted input and output.

Write function `void simple_sum(void)` that asks two integers from the
user, calculates their sum, and prints the result in the following
format: `1 + 2 = 3`. There should be a newline (\'\\n\') in the end. For
example (user input is highlighted in red, program output is shown normally):

```output
4 5 // [!code error]
4 + 5 = 9
```


**Hint:** Because scanf function ignores the whitespace characters, you
can accept inputs that involve, for example, a newline or multiple
spaces between the two numbers.

# Task - Intro #2: Fix the types (1 pts)

**Objective:** Get first touch on proper use of basic data types in C.

The exercise template contains function *fix_types*, that makes three
calculations and outputs the results. The purpose would be to print the
first result at a precision of one decimal, and the later two result as
integers. Unfortunately the function outputs incorrect results.

Fix the function in such way that it prints correct results. The
expected output is:

```output
5.3 8000000 66666
```

Do not touch the *printf* line, but correct the data types defined for
the variables in the function.

# AALTO C Course

## Description

This is the Aalto C MOOC course from 2016 preserved and available for use offline.

I started this course back in 2016 and enjoyed it, but was unable to finish it before it was taken down. I've found bits and pieces from around the internet, updated some code and wanted to package it in a way other people can also learn.

Special thanks to [Ivanic](https://github.com/ivanicspeter92/2016-aalto-c/tree/master) for uploading the exercises to github.
